                            <li><strong>Too much inventory:</strong> Ties up capital, incurs storage costs, risks obsolescence, and can lead to waste.</li>

            <p class="mb-6">This section outlines the practical activities for the session, including a conceptual demonstration of inventory optimization and preparation for an upcoming group activity.</p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-indigo-600 mb-3">Tool Demo (Conceptual): Simple Inventory Optimization Example</h3>
            <p class="mb-4 text-stone-700">This demonstration aims to illustrate the theoretical concepts of inventory optimization with a practical, albeit simplified, example using historical sales data. Imagine a small bakery needing to decide how many loaves of popular bread to bake daily to minimize waste and lost sales.</p>
            <p class="font-semibold text-stone-700 mb-2">Conceptual Demo Steps (using Excel/Python):</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 space-y-1 text-stone-700">
                <li><strong>Data Setup:</strong> Show a simple dataset with columns like `Date`, `Daily Sales (Loaves)`, `Promotions (Yes/No)`, `Day of Week`.</li>
                <li><strong>Basic Statistics:</strong> Calculate `Average`, `Median`, `Max`, `Min` for `Daily Sales`.</li>
                <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Create a simple line chart of `Daily Sales` over time to visualize trends or seasonality.</li>
                <li><strong>Simple Analysis:</strong> Use basic functions (e.g., `AVERAGEIF` in Excel or `groupby` in Python Pandas) to see if sales are higher on weekends or during promotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Conceptual Discussion:</strong> Discuss how this basic analysis, along with a buffer (safety stock), could inform daily baking decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mt-4 p-3 bg-indigo-50 border-l-4 border-indigo-600 text-indigo-700 rounded-md">
                <strong>Key Learning:</strong> Even simple historical data and basic analytical techniques can provide valuable insights for operational decisions like inventory management, laying the groundwork for more complex forecasting.

                <li><strong>2. Brainstorm at least two distinct Data Analytics applications</strong> within that chosen industry.</li>
                <li><strong>3. For each application, be prepared to briefly explain:</strong>
