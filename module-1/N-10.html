            <p class="mb-6">Data Analytics is not a monolithic field; it encompasses a range of techniques that answer different types of business questions. These can generally be categorized into three main types, each building upon the previous one in terms of complexity and value. Think of it as a progression: you first need to understand the past, then forecast the future, and finally, recommend actions.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">This session provided a comprehensive overview of how data analytics impacts various industries and formally introduced the three core types of analytics. Key insights include:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-stone-700">
                <li>Data Analytics is highly versatile, providing value across all business functions, from marketing and sales to finance, operations, HR, and beyond.</li>
                <li>The ability to apply DA to specific business problems and articulate its value is crucial for data professionals.</li>
                <li>The three types of analytics—Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive—represent a progression in complexity and actionable insights.</li>
                <li>Descriptive analytics provides the foundation by explaining "what happened."</li>
                <li>Predictive analytics builds on this to forecast "what could happen."</li>
                <li>Prescriptive analytics is the most advanced, recommending "what should we do" to achieve optimal outcomes.</li>
                <li>Understanding the distinctions and interconnections between these types is fundamental to designing effective data-driven solutions.</li>
