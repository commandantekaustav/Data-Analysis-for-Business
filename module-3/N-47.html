            <p class="section-intro">A well-crafted data story is more than just a collection of facts; it's a journey that takes your audience from a problem to a solution, using data as the guide. This session focuses on the classic narrative arc and how each element can be effectively supported by carefully chosen data visualizations.</p>
            
            <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-lg mb-8">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-indigo-500 mb-3">Elements of a Data Story: The Narrative Arc</h3>
                <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">Just like a compelling movie or book, a data story benefits from a structured narrative. This structure helps maintain audience engagement, build a logical argument, and ensure your message is clearly understood and remembered.</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-gray-700 mb-4">
                    <li><strong>1. Setup (The Context/Beginning):</strong>
                        <ul class="list-circle pl-5 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Establish the background, current situation, and what the audience already knows. Set the stage for the problem or opportunity you're addressing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Questions it answers:</strong> What is the business problem? Why is this important now? What's the status quo?</li>
                            <li><strong>Supporting Visuals:</strong> Often high-level KPIs, simple trend lines, or summary statistics that provide a baseline understanding. You might use a simple text card or a gauge chart here.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2. Inciting Incident / Conflict (The Problem/Question):</strong>
                        <ul class="list-circle pl-5 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Introduce the core problem, challenge, or question that your data analysis aims to solve. This creates tension and hooks the audience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Questions it answers:</strong> What's the specific issue we're facing? What question are we trying to answer with data? What's the 'spark' that initiates the investigation?</li>
                            <li><strong>Supporting Visuals:</strong> A chart highlighting a concerning trend (e.g., a sudden drop in sales on a line chart), a comparison showing underperformance (e.g., a bar chart comparing actual vs. target), or a simple number showing a negative metric.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>3. Rising Action (The Data Exploration & Evidence):</strong>
                        <ul class="list-circle pl-5 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> This is the core of your data story, where you present the evidence and build your argument. Each visualization should reveal a piece of the puzzle, leading logically to your main insight.</li>
                            <li><strong>Questions it answers:</strong> What data did we look at? What patterns did we find? What relationships exist?</li>
                            <li><strong>Supporting Visuals:</strong> This is where you use a variety of charts (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, detailed line/bar charts) to explore different aspects of the data, break down the problem, and show contributing factors. Each chart should be accompanied by clear explanations of what it shows.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>4. Climax (The Key Insight / "Aha!" Moment):</strong>
                        <ul class="list-circle pl-5 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The most important finding or revelation from your analysis. It's the answer to the inciting incident. This should be presented clearly and powerfully.</li>
                            <li><strong>Questions it answers:</strong> What is the single most important thing we learned? What's the core answer to our problem?</li>
                            <li><strong>Supporting Visuals:</strong> Often a single, impactful chart that clearly illustrates the key insight, possibly with annotations to draw attention to the critical data points. This might be a highly focused version of a previous chart or a new summary visual.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>5. Falling Action (Implications & Secondary Findings):</strong>
                        <ul class="list-circle pl-5 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Elaborate on the implications of your key insight and discuss any secondary, but still important, findings. Address potential counter-arguments or nuances.</li>
                            <li><strong>Questions it answers:</strong> What are the consequences of this insight? Are there other factors to consider?</li>
                            <li><strong>Supporting Visuals:</strong> Charts that provide supporting details, show breakdown of the main insight, or explore related factors.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>6. Resolution (Recommendations / Call to Action):</strong>
                        <ul class="list-circle pl-5 mt-2">
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Conclude with clear, actionable recommendations or next steps based on your data-driven insights. What should the audience *do* now?</li>
                            <li><strong>Questions it answers:</strong> What specific actions should we take? What's the path forward? What's the expected outcome?</li>
                            <li><strong>Supporting Visuals:</strong> Might be a simple summary table of recommendations, a timeline for implementation, or a visual showing projected outcomes if recommendations are followed.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
